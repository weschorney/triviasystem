This repository contains code for a simple trivia game implementation.

The game is set-up from a JSON file, which lists participants and questions. The game can be played with any number of participants, and is turn-based. Each individual question is itself a JSON object, and must have the fields in the sample setup.json file included in the repo.

The game can then be started by running 'python trivia_class.py' at the command line.
